So these papers fall under a narrow definition computational neuroscience & computational cognitive science, and either use real brain data, or explicitly try to explore (artificial) neural network similarity to neuroscience. This list doesn't involve the papers which are primarily behavioral studies (mostly bayesian human behavior model papers), a broader definition would yield more papers.

Our paper was submitted under the `applications to neuroscience & cognitive science` primary area, one of the official primary areas by ICLR in OpenReview. [ICLR 2013](https://iclr.cc/archive/2013/call-for-papers.html#:~:text=applications%20in%20vision%2C%20audio%2C%20speech%2C%20and%20natural%20language%20processing%2C%20robotics%20and%20neuroscience) (first conference) up to [ICLR 2024](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/CallForPapers#:~:text=applications%20to%20neuroscience%20%26%20cognitive%20science) have included `applications to neuroscience` in their call for papers.
